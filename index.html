I am a programmer with over 15 years of experience, specialising in development for OS X. I'm based in Sheffield in the UK. I am the creator of [MovingImages](http://zukini.eu/movingimages), a movie processing scripting tool that allows Mac video editors to automate the creating and editing of video content.

## What I can do

**I build robust, powerful platforms for OS X**. I created the MovingImages platform for OS X and iOS and built on top of it the MovingImages video processing scripting tool. The scripting tool is a LaunchAgent which links in the MovingImages framework. Communication with the LaunchAgent is done using Apple's XPC interprocess communication protocol from a command line tool and the video processing scripts are written in ruby.

**I enjoy learning new technologies and tools so that I can build things**. Most recently I have been learning Swift, which I have used for writing tests for the MovingImages framework and for writing an SVG renderer. Prior that I was learning Ruby and wrote a gem to generate the JSON content that MovingImages understands.

**I am experienced with XcodeServer** having been tasked to implement a range of automated bots for building, testing and releasing. 

**I can write documentation**. I've written clear, comprehensive, user-focused documentation for [MovingImages](http://zukini.eu/docs/Contents).

**I can work alone or as part of a team**. At [Softpress](http://softpress.com), working on Freeway was a team effort. As well as the engineering side of my job I was responsible for making release builds and managing translations for the web design applications Freeway Pro and Freeway Express.

**I connect with the tech community**. I co-founded the Sheffield Swift meet-ups, a monthly get-together for people who work with the Swift programming language, I gave the first talk and I have also spoken at the NSManchester meetup about XcodeServer

**I am comfortable working with large businesses**. As director of Yarra Valley Software, I contracted for large corporate clients such as TetraPak and Citrix.

**I am comfortable in the charity and activist sector**. In my personal life, I have been an active campaigner for Global Justice Now and the Green Party of England and Wales.

## Technical skills and education

I am experienced with using XcodeServer for creating bots to run tests, do nightly builds, and create release builds for an OS X Application.

Skilled in framework development for OS X and iOS and recently created MovingImages, an OS X and iOS framework written in Objective-C. MovingImages represents the functionality of CoreImage, CoreGraphics, the movie-editing parts of AVFoundation and parts of CoreText as JSON objects, which requires a high level of understanding of these Apple technologies.

I am experienced with working on large complex content creation applications. Freeway Pro and Express are powerful applications providing the user with a large range of functionality via an extensive user interface. The main codebase for Freeway is written in C and C++. I am an experienced Objective-C, C++ and C developer and am rapidly improving my Swift language skills.

I am experienced with using git, GitHub and GitLab. We used Jira at Softpress for project management and bug tracking. I've used GitLab's issue tracking tools and Trello for managing tasks whilst working on MovingImages.

I have a basic level of German language reading skills.

**B.Sc. Physics with honours**. I gained a 2:1. [University of New South Wales](https://unsw.edu.au), 1990. 

**Graduate Diploma in Robotics**. [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu), 1995.
